# Chat
Chat is based on frameworks as WCF and .NET

I made this chat as duplex(when methods calls from server). Also I used here net.tcp binging for messaging and mexTcpBinging for metadata.

So you can easily host it on IIS and check it out.

If you want to globalize it, don't forget about:

  * Open the ports.
  
  * Turn off your firewall.
  
  * Check if the tcp service is working.
  
  * Make sure you changed ip in config files to your own ip
  
  
  P.S. The chat is not perfect, but it works!
